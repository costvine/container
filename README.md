# CostvineÂ® Container

![Costvine](https://costvine.app/img/logo.svg)

Costvine is a web app for creating heirarchical budgets of all kinds. It's targeted at project managers and cost estimators in various industries, including finance, construction, manufacturing, and event planning, along with anyone who needs to create a large or complex budget.

This container is used both for development and for running CI/CD tasks at [Costvine](https://costvine.com). This makes perfect sense to us, in terms of reproducibility, and saving duplication of effort. But it never seems to have occurred to Microsoft, and was maddeningly difficult to debug. The approach does work, however, and this example works well for us.

There are some sample supporting scripts in the `scripts` folder, however these are not burned into the container--they're intended to be run from the workspace after the container is loaded. These represent a small fraction of the commands available in the Costvine Monorepo Tools.

## Versions of Key Tools

The versions of Python, Node, PNPM and Poetry are all controlled through environment variables set in the Dockerfile. Everything else is essentially the latest stable version at the time the container was built. This container is refreshed periodically.

## Tools Included

In addition to everything installed in the base image, this container includes:

- Astral's Python installer/package manager, uv
- Python
- Poetry
- Node Version Manager (nvm)
- NodeJS (node) and the Node Package Manager (npm)
- PNPM
- Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)
- Google Cloud Storage FUSE
- Google Cloud SQL Proxy
- Postgres client (psql)
- Libraries required to build many things from source

The extra libraries are not currently used by the container itself.

## Support

This container is primarily used internally at Costvine and by a small number of commercial licensees of the Costvine components, and is constrained to serve that purpose, however you're welcome to use it in your own CDEs or CI/CI pipelines and we welcome any feedback.
